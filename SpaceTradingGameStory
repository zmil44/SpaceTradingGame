It is the year 2518 and you have just turned 24 years old. After graduating from the Space Pilot Academy, you have decided to travel the stars and trade with people from different planets. You're parents have been supportive of your decision and have given you a ship and 25,000 credits to start your journey. Your ship is a Simiyar-Class Light Frieghter, has a maximum storage of 50 goods, and has a max warp speed of 3. Your goal is to earn as many credits as possible after travelling for 40 years. Good luck, and may the force be with you!
